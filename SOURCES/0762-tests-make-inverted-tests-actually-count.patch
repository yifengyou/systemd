Subject: [PATCH] tests: make inverted tests actually count
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

"! test ..." does not cause the script to fail, even with set -e.
IIUC, bash treats this command as part of an expression line, as it
would if 'test ... && ...' was used. Failing expression lines do not
terminate the script.

This fixes the obvious cases by changing '! test' â†’ 'test !'.
Then the inversion happens internally in test and bash will propagate
the failure.

(cherry picked from commit ffa328f060f437f3e1f0f0cb13513ee3dd9c3da5)
