Subject: [PATCH] pstore: fix crash and forward dummy arguments instead of NULL

[msekleta: in our version of systemd "const char path*" argument of
path_join() can't be NULL. Here we don't really want any subdirs paths
passed into move_file(), but we can't just pass NULL pointers because
they will be forwarded to path_join(). Hence, let's just pass "/"
instead.]
